## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```
## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'New_Neth22' not found
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


```
## Warning: Removed 15 rows containing missing values (geom_path).
```

![plot of chunk pressure](figure/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
